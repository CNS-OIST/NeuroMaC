NeuroMaC: Neuronal Morphologies & Circuits
------------------------------------------

We think that to fully understand neuronal morphologies, circuits and their variance we have to look at the substrate at large. That is, how neurons developed and interactions between a developing neuron and the substrate (e.g., toher neurons, boundaries, capillaries,...) influence their morphology. For this purpose we developed *NeuroMaC*

*NeuroMaC is a phenomenological, computational framework to generate \
large numbers of virtual neuronal morphologies (and resultant \
microcircuits) simultaneously according to growth-rules expressed in \
terms of interactions with the environment.*

- **NeuroMaC**: Neuronal Morphologies & Circuits
- **Computational framework**: a suite of software tools built around \
  a central concept
- **Virtual neuronal morphologies**: 3D digital descriptions of \
  neuronal shape (both axons and dendrites)
- **Microcircuits**: Morphologies are generated together in a \
  simulated volume. With the addition of connections rules circuits emerge.
- **Interactions**: Growth-cones branch, terminate and elongate. Each \
  of these steps can be influenced by environmental cues. Most obvious \
  is guidance through repulsion and attraction to simulated cues.
- **Phenomenological**: Neither biochemical pathways nor physics are \
  simulated. As such, growth is purely phenomenological. NeuroMaC is \
  not a simulator of actual neuronal development.

.. warning:: Currenly, a prototype of NeuroMaC is implemented in Python. \
  This version is a proof-of-principle and nothing beyond that. This \
  prototype has many limitations and we are working towards a \
  non-prototype version, which should be released in the next year. \
  The current prototype code is freely available.
