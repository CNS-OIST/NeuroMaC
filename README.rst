NeuroMaC: Neuronal Morphologies & Circuits
------------------------------------------

We think that to fully understand neuronal morphologies, circuits and their variance we have to look at the substrate at large. That is, how neurons developed and interactions between a developing neuron and the substrate (e.g., toher neurons, boundaries, capillaries,...) influence their morphology.

For this purpose we developed *NeuroMaC*, a phenomenological simulator of neuronal morphology and circuits. NeuroMac allows users to generate virtual morphologies according to growth rules.
