NeuroMaC examples
=================

This section provides examples highlighting the  key features of NeuroMac \
and illustrate how to use the software suite.

All examples are found in the :code:`examples` directory. Bash shell \
scripts are available to run the models and convert the raw output into \
useful output (such as a SWC-file or figure). Check these shell scripts \
for individual commands.

.. note:: For beginners it is strongly advised not to start a NeuroMac \
   model from scratch but to start with an example and adopt it to \
   meet your needs.
