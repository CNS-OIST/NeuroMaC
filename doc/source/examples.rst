NeuroMaC examples
=================

This section provides examples highlighting key features of NeuroMac \
and illustrate how to use the software suite.

All examples are found in the :code:`examples` directory. Bash shell \
scripts are available to run and model and convert the raw output into \
useful output (such as a SWC file or figure)

.. note:: For beginners it is strangely advised not to start a NeuroMac \
   model from scratch but to start with an example and adopt to meet your \
   needs.
